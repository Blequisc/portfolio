    "aboutMeText": "My name is Gustavo and I am 18 years old. I use the acronym \"Bléqui\" online, it started as a nickname for gaming but today it has become almost like a second name for me. I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Nove de Julho. I am also a trained IT technician and an informal web developer. In my free time, I enjoy playing games, listening to music, and learning new things, but my main passion is art, more specifically cinema. I speak Portuguese and English, in which my level is B2 according to the Cambridge proficiency test, and I also study Spanish and Russian."
